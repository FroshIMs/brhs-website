          <p>Health and Safety is a key part of Jamalco’s sustainability strategy. Making the right decisions for our business - by examining and addressing sustainability challenges - means we take into account the direct and indirect impacts to the communities and environment in which we operate.</p>
          <p>To improve our employees’ and contractors’ work environment, we ensure the necessary focus on safety systems at work, risk management, medical aid and the correct use of personal protective equipment. These are the fundamentals which are becoming mandatory within our operations through a set of key performance indicators for employees and contractors.</p>
